# Hand_gesture_recognition

Final Year Project created to classify hand gestures using CNN and predict real-time results with OpenCv

### Objective
The aim is to build a hand gesture recognition model with deep learning. This model will classify images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, thumb, and others. 
This model could be used for communicating with the deaf and dumb using these various gestures.
This will help to make the communication between the deaf/dumb and the people who donâ€™t understand sign language a lot easier.
It can also be used in applications involving gesture navigation.

## Steps to Run :
Clone the repository

### Prerequisites
